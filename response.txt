        "howToUseIt": "Create an instance of the VehiclePriceCalculatorFinalFinal class by providing the RRP, damage check result, last MOT date, and last service date as arguments. Then, call the getPrice() method on the instance to get the final price of the vehicle. Example: $calculator = new VehiclePriceCalculatorFinalFinal(10000, 'Orange', new DateTimeImmutable('2020-01-01'), new DateTimeImmutable('2021-01-01')); $finalPrice = $calculator->getPrice();"
